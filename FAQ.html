                  Registered attendees of the Asilomar Conference are eligible for the reduced hotel
                  registration
                  fee shown on the registration form. Attendees must request lodging via the hotel
                  registration
                  request form included for the conference to qualify for that specific rate. Note that
                  Asilomar
                  Conference Grounds now has an online registration form. Hotel Registration forms must
                  include
                  proof of payment in order to be processed. Forms sent out without proof of payment will
                  be
                  discarded. Once complete hotel registration forms are received, registration staff will
                  send by
                  e-mail or fax confirmation that the paperwork has been received within 48 hours of
                  reception
                  (regular mail confirmation will be sent if no e-mail/fax information is included). A
                  second
                  e-mail will be sent out to confirm lodging after request has been processed. At that
                  time the
                  credit card will be charged if applicable. Full-time registration requests are given
                  1st
                  priority and such lodging requests will usually be confirmed within a week to 10 days.
                  Attendees are strongly encouraged to request full-time lodging if they wish to
                  guarantee a
                  room. Part-time requests will be given lower priority and such requests are confirmed
                  only when
                  space is available. In such cases confirmation should not be expected more than 30 days
                  before
                  the conference, if part-time room lodging space is available.

                  must be listed in the technical program (as authors, co-authors, session chairs or
                  organizers)
                  to receive an invitation letter. Authors requiring letters of invitation to obtain
                  travel visas
                  to present their papers need to contact Conference Staff by e-mail at
                  InviteLetter@asilomarssc.org. If you have any specific requirements regarding your visa
                  letter,
                  make sure to include your requirements in your email. Please, include the paper number,
                  author(s), and title in your correspondence. Invitation letters to the technical
                  meeting are
                  specifically addressed to authors presenting papers at the Conference and cannot be
                  amended to
                  include relatives wishing to travel with the author. All letters of invitation will be
                  sent by
                  e-mail (as PDF attachments), airmail or faxed. Please allow ample time for processing
                  requests.
                  The Conference staff is not able to contact U.S. Embassies in support of an individual
                  attempting to gain entry to attend the conference. We recommend that you start your
                  visa
                  application process as soon as you have been notified that your paper has been
                  accepted, as the
                  visa application process can be lengthy. Cancellations after the registration cutoff
                  will
                  result in a cancellation fee.
