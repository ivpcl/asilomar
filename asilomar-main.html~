	     <p> The Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers is a yearly
		 Conference held on the Asilomar Grounds in Pacific Grove, CA, USA.  The
		 IEEE Signal Processing Society is a technical co-sponsor.
         It provides a forum for presenting recent and novel work in various
		 areas of theoretical and applied signal processing.</p>
 
		 <p>General areas of interest to the forum include:
		 <ul><li>Architecture and Implementation
			 <li>Array Signal Processing	
             <li>Biomedical Signal & Image Processing
			 <li>Communication Systems
			 <li>MIMO Communications & Signal Processing
			 <li>Networks
			 <li>Signal Processing & Adaptive Systems
			 <li>Speech, Image & Video Processing
	     </ul></p>

		 <p>Recent meetings have presented a wide array of work ranging from
		 results in blind source separation, random networks, MIMO
		 communications, low dimensional signal models to applications of signal
		 processing in control, wireless communications, financial engineering,
		 smart grids, biological systems, medical imaging, and big data.</p>
