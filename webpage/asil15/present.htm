<p><strong>Instructions for Poster Preparation:</strong>
Poster sessions are a good way for authors to present papers and 
meet with interested attendees for in-depth technical discussions. 
In addition attendees find the poster sessions a good way to sample many 
papers in parallel sessions. Thus it is important that you display your message clearly 
and strikingly so as to attract people who might have an interest in your paper.</p> 

<p>For your poster, a board will be provided which measures 4 ft x 8 ft. 
Push tacks will be available to tack your paper to the poster. 
Prepare your poster well in advance of the conference. 
There will be no time or materials available for last minute preparation at the 
conference.
</p>
   
<p>The title of your paper should appear at the top of your poster in CAPITAL 
letters that are at least 1 inch high. Below the title put author(s) name(s) and 
affiliation(s). Use pictures, cartoons, and figures rather than text wherever possible. 
Bright colors greatly enhance the attention of the viewer. Use text sparingly. 
State the main result of your paper in six or less lines using 3/4 inch high letters.
The flow of your paper should be from top left to bottom right. 
You may use arrows to lead through the paper.</p>
     
<p><strong>Poster Presentation:</strong>
       Prepare a short presentation of about 5 to 15 minutes that can be given to 
       the attendees. Be prepared to repeat presentation several times. 
       Plan to spend the entire session at your poster.</p>
