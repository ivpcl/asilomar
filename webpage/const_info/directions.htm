		InviteLetter@asilomarssc.org</a>. Please, include the paper

    All letters of invitation will be sent by e-mail (as PDF attachments), airmail or faxed. Please allow ample time for processing requests.
    The Conference staff is not able to contact U.S. Embassies in support of an individual attempting to gain entry to attend
    the conference. We recommend that you start your visa application process as soon as you have been
      notified that your paper has been accepted, as the visa
    application process can be lengthy. Cancellations after the
    registration cutoff will result in a cancellation fee.&nbsp;</li>
