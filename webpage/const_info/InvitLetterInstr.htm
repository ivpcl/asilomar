<p>Individuals requiring letters of invitation to the Technical Meeting to obtain travel visas must be 
listed in the program to receive an invitation letter.
Authors requiring letters of invitation to obtain travel 
	visas to present their papers need to contact Conference Staff by e-mail at
<a href="mailto:InviteLetter@asilomarssc.org">InviteLetter@asilomarssc.org</a>. Please, include the paper 
	number, author(s), and title in your correspondence.&nbsp; Invitation 
letters to the technical meeting are specifically addressed to authors 
presenting papers at the Conference and cannot be amended to include relatives 
wishing to travel with the author.</p>
<p>All letters of invitation will be sent by e-mail (as PDF 
attachments), airmail or faxed. Please allow ample time for processing requests.
</p>
<p>The Conference staff is not able to contact U.S. Embassies in support of an 
individual attempting to gain entry to attend the conference. We recommend that 
you start your visa application process as soon as you have been notified that 
your paper has been accepted, as the visa application process can be lengthy. 
Cancellations after the registration cutoff will result in a cancellation fee.
