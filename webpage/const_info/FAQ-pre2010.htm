<strong><a name="creditcard">Credit card issues:</a> </strong>We accept credit cards
  (VISA and MC only ) for the Technical Conference registration.  We also accept: checks in US dollars drawn on a US bank,
  traveler checks, cash.
  We DO NOT accept checks drawn on foreign banks. Note, the Conference grounds hotel accepts credit cards for the hotel
  registration.
</li>
<p><li><strong><a name="registrations">Can I combine hotel and conference registrations?</a></strong>
No, hotel and conference registration must be sent SEPARATELY to the two locations, as indicated on the registration forms.

<p><li><strong><a name="soldoutrooms">I tried to stay at the Conference hotel, but they are sold out, can I still pay 
reduced technical registration rates?</a>
  </strong>No. We buy a block of rooms a year ahead, and we offer the rooms on a first come first basis, with priority given to three-day registrants.  Some years rooms 
  get sold out, and most years "historic rate" rooms get sold out quite early. We encourage you to book quite early. The hotel 
  registration process is handled directly by Asilomar staff at the Conference grounds and they will do their best to fit you in.  
  However, you will be required to pay the conference off-grounds rate if you don't stay on the conference grounds even though you 
  may have requested an on-ground room and were turned away.
<p><li><strong><a name="ReducedFees">How can I qualify for the reduced technical conference fees?</a></strong>
Reduced technical conference fees are available ONLY if you obtain lodging at the conference hotel by returning the hotel registration 
fees included on this site or in the advanced technical program. Lodging reservations made thru a third party outfit, such as Expedia or 
Orbitz for example, or registration made with the Asilomar Conference Center via the Leisure guest program DO NOT QUALIFY for&nbsp; 
reduced technical conference fees.
<p><li><strong><a name="hotel process">Hotel registration process</a> </strong>
To be eligible for the reduced technical hotel conference fee, attendees must 
request lodging via the hotel registration request form included for the 
conference. Note that Asilomar has 
no online registration or e-mail hotel registration form available at this time. Hotel Registration forms must include proof of payment in order to 
be processed. Forms sent out without proof of payment will be discarded. Once complete hotel registration forms are received, 
registration staff will send within an e-mail confirming that the paperwork has been received within 48 hours of reception 
(regular mail confirmation will be sent if no e-mail information is included). A 
second e-mail will be sent out to confirm lodging after request has been 
processed.&nbsp; At that time the credit card will be charged if applicable. Full-time registration requests are given 1st priority 
and such lodging requests will usually be confirmed within a week to 10 days.  Attendees are strongly encouraged to request full-time lodging if they 
wish to guarantee a room. Part-time requests will be given lower priority and such requests are confirmed only when space is available. 
In such cases confirmation should not be expected more than 30 days before the conference, if 
part-time room lodging space is available.


<p><li><strong><a name="publishpaper">What are the restrictions for the papers to get published in the Proceedings?</a></strong>
The conference has a long standing policy to restrict publication to papers which were presented by one of the authors of the paper, 
and that at least of the authors of the given paper be registered at the conference.  No exception
  is made.  This restriction is indicated in several locations on the Conference website 
and applies to the combined number of invited and submitted papers for a given 
author. Authors are held responsible for insuring that they adhere to this policy. 
Uploaded final papers found to be in violation of this policy will be removed 
from the conference proceedings.

<p><li><strong><a name="notification">I didn't get a notification letter to my submission</a></strong>. 
Due to the short turn around between submission and selection deadlines, we do not send
acknowledgments to each paper submission received. However, e-mail notifications
are sent to each author which e-mail was included on the electronic submissions.
We send e-mail notifying authors and co-authors of their paper status by the end of
August, to those which e-mail address was included in their electronic
submissions. If you did not receive such a notification, please check with the
main POC for the paper first. A duplicate will be e-mailed by request to the Conference
Registrar.
<p><li><a name="paperstatus"><b>How will I get notified about my paper status?</b></a>
We send e-mail notifying authors and co-authors of their paper status by the end of
August, to those which e-mail address was included in their electronic
submissions. If you did not receive such a notification, please check with the
main POC for the paper first. A duplicate will be e-mailed by request to the Conference
Registrar.

<p><li> <strong><a name="paperlimit1">Is there a limit on how many papers I can submit?</a></strong>
Yes, Any individual is restricted to no more than 4 submissions total (combination of either regular or invited submissions). 
This limit is included on the Call for papers. Authors are held responsible for insuring that they adhere to this policy.&nbsp; Any submission received exceeding the limit will be rejected without review.

<p><li><b><a name="InvitLetter">How do I get an invitation letter?</strong></a>
</b>Individuals requiring letters of invitation to the Technical Meeting to obtain travel visas must be 
listed in the program to receive an invitation letter.
Authors requiring letters of invitation to obtain travel 
	visas to present their papers need to contact Ms. Sue Netzorg, Conference 
	Registrar, at <a href="mailto:sscasilomar@comcast.net">
	sscasilomar@comcast.net</a>, fax: (831) 373.8082. Please, include the paper 
	number, author(s), and title in your correspondence.&nbsp;
	Invitation letters to the technical meeting are specifically addressed to 
authors presenting papers at the Conference and cannot be amended to include relatives wishing to travel 
with the author. All letters of invitation will be sent by e-mail (as PDF attachments), airmail or 
		faxed. Please allow ample time for processing requests. The Conference 
		staff is not able to contact U.S. Embassies in support of an individual 
		attempting to gain entry to attend the conference. We recommend that you 
		start your visa application process as soon as you have been notified 
		that your paper has been accepted, as the visa application process can 
		be lengthy. Cancellations after the registration cutoff will result in a 
		cancellation fee. 
<p><li><strong><a name="projector">Will you have computer projectors available for presentations?</a></strong> We
  plan to make PC projectors available, however presenters will need to bring
  their laptop PCs, as we will <u>not</u> have laptop PCs available. <u>The 
projector model number is: Dell model&nbsp; number 4100MP</u>.&nbsp; Poster boards only are available for the poster board 
  sessions. see further details in the author kit section.

<p><li><strong><a name="Overhead">Will you have overhead transparency projectors available for 
presentations?</a> </a></strong>Due to their very limited usage in recent years, we will have </b>
Overhead transparency projectors available by advance request only. Overhead 
projectors must be requested by <u><b>Oct. 10th</b></u> by sending an e-mail to
<a href="mailto:fargues@nps.edu">fargues@nps.edu</a> . You <u><b>MUST</b></u> 
specify the paper number and session where it is to be presented, i.e., MP4a, 
TP1b, etc... to insure the request will be filled. </p>

<p><li><strong><a name="paperin">When do I need to turn my paper in?</a></strong>  
  The Asilomar Conference has an electronic submission only procedure. Papers 
must be uploaded at the conference website by the advertised deadline (check the 
&quot;Paper submission - final paper&quot; link on the main page).&nbsp; NO hard-copy 
papers will be accepted at the conference registration desk.&nbsp; Signed copyright forms must be turned

  note that only papers with signed copyright forms on file will be included in
  the proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

of 5 pages are subject to a $100.00 extra charge per page.
