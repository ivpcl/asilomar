<strong><a name="creditcard">Credit card issues:</a> </strong>We accept credit cards
  (VISA and MC only ) for the Technical Conference registration.  We also accept: checks in US dollars drawn on a US bank,
  traveler checks, cash.
  We DO NOT accept checks drawn on foreign banks. Note, the Conference grounds hotel 
now accepts credit cards for the hotel
  registration.
</li>
<p>
<li><b><a name="Online_registration:">Online registration:</a></b> Online registration 
is available for the technical registration. Online 
registration is NOT available for on grounds lodging.</li>
<p>
<li><strong><a name="registrations">Can I combine hotel and conference registrations?</a></strong>
No, hotel and conference registration must be sent SEPARATELY to the two locations, as indicated on the registration forms.

<p>
<li><strong><a name="hotel process">Hotel registration process</a> </strong>
Registered attendees of the Asilomar Conference are eligible for the reduced 
hotel registration fee shown on the registration form. Attendees must 
request lodging via the hotel registration request form included for the 
conference to qualify for that specific rate. Note that Asilomar Conference 
Grounds has 
no online registration form available at this time. Hotel Registration forms 
must include proof of payment in order to be processed. Forms sent out without 
proof of payment will be discarded. Once complete hotel registration forms are 
received, registration staff will send by e-mail or fax confirmation that the paperwork has been received within 48 hours of reception 
(regular mail confirmation will be sent if no e-mail/fax information is included). A 
second e-mail will be sent out to confirm lodging after request has been 
processed.&nbsp; At that time the credit card will be charged if applicable. Full-time registration requests are given 1st priority 
and such lodging requests will usually be confirmed within a week to 10 days.  Attendees are strongly encouraged to request full-time lodging if they 
wish to guarantee a room. Part-time requests will be given lower priority and such requests are confirmed only when space is available. 
In such cases confirmation should not be expected more than 30 days before the conference, if 
part-time room lodging space is available.
<p>
<li><strong><a name="publishpaper">What are the restrictions for the papers to get published in the Proceedings?</a></strong>&nbsp;
<font face="Times New Roman">For a paper to be included in the Asilomar 
proceedings, one of the author(s) of the paper must: 1) be physically present at 
the conference, 2) present the paper, 3) be registered at the conference, and 3) have turned in the 
copyright form at the registration desk during the conference. No exception is 
made to this policy. Finally, no more than 4 (invited or regular) papers total 
per author (or co-author) will be published. Authors are held responsible f</font>or insuring that they adhere to this policy. 
Uploaded final papers found to be in violation of this policy will be removed 
from the conference proceedings.

<p>
<li><strong><a name="notification">I didn't get a notification letter to my submission</a></strong>. 
Due to the short turn around between submission and selection deadlines, we do not send
acknowledgments to each paper submission received. However, e-mail notifications
are sent to each author which e-mail was included on the electronic submissions.
We send e-mail notifying authors and co-authors of their paper status by the end of
August, to those which e-mail address was included in their electronic
submissions. If you did not receive such a notification, please check with the
main POC for the paper first. A duplicate will be e-mailed by request to the Conference
Registrar.
<p>
<li><a name="paperstatus"><b>How will I get notified about my paper status?</b></a>
We send e-mail notifying authors and co-authors of their paper status by the end of
August, to those which e-mail address was included in their electronic
submissions. If you did not receive such a notification, please check with the
main POC for the paper first. A duplicate will be e-mailed by request to the Conference
Registrar.

<li><strong><a name="paperlimit1">Is there a limit on how many papers I can submit?</a></strong>
Yes, Any individual is restricted to no more than 4 submissions total (combination of either regular or invited submissions). 
This limit is included on the Call for papers. Authors are held responsible for insuring that they adhere to this policy.&nbsp; Any submission received 
which exceeds the limit will be rejected without review.

<p>
<li><b><a name="InvitLetter">How do I get an invitation letter?</strong></a> </b>Individuals requiring letters of invitation to the Technical Meeting to obtain travel visas must be 
listed in the program to receive an invitation letter.
Authors requiring letters of invitation to obtain travel 
	visas to present their papers need to contact Conference Staff by e-mail at
<a href="mailto:InviteLetter@asilomarssc.org">InviteLetter@asilomarssc.org</a>. Please, include the paper 
	number, author(s), and title in your correspondence.&nbsp;
	Invitation letters to the technical meeting are specifically addressed to 
authors presenting papers at the Conference and cannot be amended to include relatives wishing to travel 
with the author. All letters of invitation will be sent by e-mail (as PDF attachments), airmail or 
		faxed. Please allow ample time for processing requests. The Conference 
		staff is not able to contact U.S. Embassies in support of an individual 
		attempting to gain entry to attend the conference. We recommend that you 
		start your visa application process as soon as you have been notified 
		that your paper has been accepted, as the visa application process can 
		be lengthy. Cancellations after the registration cutoff will result in a 
		cancellation fee.
