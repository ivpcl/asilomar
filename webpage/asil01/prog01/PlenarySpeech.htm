     Technology has given us the capabilities to develop systems   
     that continue to get smaller and smarter. Examples of these   
     smaller and smarter systems include microrobots, micro air   
     vehicles, and micro satellites. Signal processing has allowed us   
     to also expand the capabilities of these systems to interact with   
     their environment through new sensing systems and faster   
     computers. But one of the most exciting new capabilities for   
     these smaller and smarter systems is the possibility to work   
     together collaboratively. Collective behavior opens up many   
     new possibilities. Consider the opportunities for swarms of   
     micro air vehicles, or clusters of microsatellites, or groups of   
     underwater autonomous vehicles. Learning algorithms and   
     adaptive signal processing becomes a key element of the   
     development of these new systems. This presentation will   
     consider some of the new technologies and algorithms for this   
     vision of the future.

  Biography</i></b>   
<p>
  Dr. Etter has held the positions of Deputy Under Secretary of   
  Defense for Science and Technology, and Deputy Director of   
  Defense Research and Engineering, since June 1998. She is
responsible   
  for Defense Science and Technology strategic planning,   
  budget allocation, and program execution and evaluation.   
  Additionally she ensures that the National Defense objectives   
  are met by the $9 billion per year DoD Science and Technology   
  Program. Dr. Etter coordinates NATO science and technology   
  collaborative efforts and is the Principal U.S. Representative
to   
  the NATO Research and Technology Board and to The Technical   
  Cooperation Program between Australia, Canada, New   
  Zealand, United Kingdom and the U.S. She is also responsible   
  for the DoD High Performance Computing Modernization Program,   
  the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office, management   
  oversight of the Software Engineering Institute (SEI), and
executive   
  agent for software intensive systems.&nbsp;

  During 1979-1989, Dr. Etter was a faculty member in the
Department   
  of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of   
  New Mexico (UNM). She served as Associate Chair of the
Department   
  from 1987-1989. During 1989, she also served as Associate   
  Vice President for Academic Affairs at UNM. Dr. Etter spent   
  two summers at Sandia National Laboratories working in the area   
  of seismic signal processing. During the 1983-1984 academic year   
  she was a National Science Foundation Visiting Professor in the   
  Electrical Engineering Department at Stanford University.   
  Dr. Etter attended Oklahoma State University and the University   
  of Texas at Arlington, and received B.S. and M.S. degrees in   
  mathematics in 1970 and 1972 from Wright State University in   
  Dayton, Ohio. She received her Ph.D. in electrical engineering   
  from the University of New Mexico in 1979.   
  She and her husband, Jerry, reside in Northern Virginia.
