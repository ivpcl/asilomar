<hr>
<p>Poster sessions are a good way for authors to present papers and
meet with interested attendees for in-depth technical discussions.
In addition attendees find the poster sessions a good way to sample
many papers in parallel sessions.  Thus it is important that you
display your message clearly and strikingly so as to attract people
who might have an interest in your paper.

<p>The presentation format of your paper is indicated by the paper number. All
poster presentation formats have paper numbers with numeric &quot;8&quot;, such
as MP8a, TP8b, etc... Please see further 
details <a href="http://web.nps.navy.mil/~asilomar/asil01/prog01/paper_format.htm" target="rbottom"> here</a> regarding
how to identify the specific paper format.
<p>
<b>POSTER PREPARATION</b>

<ul>
<li>For your poster, a board will be provided which measures 4 ft
x 8 ft.  Push tacks will be available to tack your paper to the
poster.
<li>Prepare your poster well in advance of the conference. There
will be no time or materials available for last minute preparation
at the conference.
<li>The title of your paper should appear at the top of your
poster in CAPITAL letters that are at least 1 inch high. Below the
title put author(s) name(s) and affiliation(s).
<li>Use pictures, cartoons, and figures rather than text wherever
possible.  Bright colors greatly enhance the attention of the
viewer.
<li>Use text sparingly. State the main result of your paper in
six or less lines using 3/4 inch high letters.
The flow of your paper should be from top left to bottom
right. You may use arrows to lead through the paper.
</ul>
<b>POSTER PRESENTATION</b>

<p>Prepare a short presentation of about 5 to 15 minutes that can be
given to the attendees.  Be prepared to repeat presentation several
times.  Plan to spend the entire session at your poster.
