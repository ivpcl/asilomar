    <p>Individuals requiring letters of invitation to obtain
		travel visas must be listed in the program to receive an invitation
		letter. Individuals requiring letters of invitation to obtain travel
		visas to present their papers need to send an e-mail to Conference Staff
		at <a href="mailto:InviteLetter@asilomarssc.org">
		InviteLetter@asilomarssc.org</a>. Please, include the paper
      number, author(s), and title in your correspondence.</p>

    <p>All letters of invitation will be sent by e-mail (as PDF attachments), airmail
     or faxed. Please allow ample time for processing requests.
    The Conference staff is not able to contact U.S. Embassies in support of an individual
    attempting to gain entry to attend
    the conference. We recommend that you start your visa application process as soon as you have been
      notified that your paper has been accepted, as the visa
    application process can be lengthy. Cancellations after the
    registration cutoff will result in a cancellation fee.</p>
