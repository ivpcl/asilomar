       Can you explain the registration process to get lodging

<div id="reg" class="collapse">
Registered attendees of the Asilomar Conference are eligible for the reduced
hotel registration fee shown on the registration form. Attendees must
request lodging via the hotel registration request form included for the
conference to qualify for that specific rate. Note that Asilomar Conference
Grounds <strong>now has an online registration form</strong>. Hotel Registration forms
must include proof of payment in order to be processed. Forms sent out without
proof of payment will be discarded. Once complete hotel registration forms are
received, registration staff will send by e-mail or fax confirmation that the paperwork has been received within 48 hours of reception
(regular mail confirmation will be sent if no e-mail/fax information is included). A
second e-mail will be sent out to confirm lodging after request has been
processed.&nbsp; At that time the credit card will be charged if applicable. Full-time registration requests are given 1st priority
and such lodging requests will usually be confirmed within a week to 10 days.  Attendees are strongly encouraged to request full-time lodging if they
wish to guarantee a room. Part-time requests will be given lower priority and such requests are confirmed only when space is available.
In such cases confirmation should not be expected more than 30 days before the conference, if
part-time room lodging space is available.

    from the Technical Meeting to obtain travel visas
    <strong style="color:red;">must be listed in the technical program
      (as authors, co-authors, session chairs or organizers)</strong>
     to receive an invitation letter. Authors requiring letters of invitation

     Conference Staff by e-mail at
     <a href="mailto:InviteLetter@asilomarssc.org">InviteLetter@asilomarssc.org</a>.

       make sure to include your requirements in your email.</strong>
     Please, include the paper number, author(s), and title in your correspondence.
    Invitation letters to the technical meeting are specifically addressed to
    authors presenting papers at the Conference and cannot be amended to
    include relatives wishing to travel with the author. All letters of
    invitation will be sent by e-mail (as PDF attachments), airmail or faxed.

    The Conference staff is not able to contact U.S. Embassies in support of an
    individual attempting to gain entry to attend the conference.
    We recommend that you start your visa application process as soon as you
    have been notified that your paper has been accepted, as the visa
    application process can be lengthy. Cancellations after the registration
    cutoff will result in a cancellation fee.
