<strong><a name="creditcard">Credit card issues:</a> </strong>We accept credit cards
  (VISA and MC only ) for the Technical Conference registration.  We also accept: checks in US dollars drawn on a US bank,
  traveler checks, cash.
  We DO NOT accept checks drawn on foreign banks. Note, the Conference grounds hotel accepts credit cards for the hotel
  registration.

<p>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong><a name="registrations">Can I combine hotel and conference registrations?</a></strong>
No, hotel and conference registration must be sent SEPARATELY to the two locations, as indicated on the registration forms.

<p><li><strong><a name="soldoutrooms">I tried to stay at the Conference hotel, but they are sold out, can I still pay on-grounds rates?</a>
  </strong>No, We buy a block of rooms a year ahead, and we offer the rooms on a first come first basis, with priority given to three-day registrants.  Some years rooms get sold out, and most years "historic rate" rooms get sold out quite early. We encourage you to book quite early. The hotel registration process is handled directly by Asilomar staff at the Conference grounds and they will do their best to fit you in.  However, you will be required to pay the conference off-grounds rate if you don't stay on the conference grounds even though you may have requested an on-ground room and were turned away.

<p><li><strong><a name="publishpaper">What are the restrictions for the papers to get published in the Proceedings ?</a></strong>
The conference has a long standing policy to restrict publication to papers which were presented by one of the authors of the paper, and that at least of the authors of the given paper be registered at the conference.  No exception
  is made.  This restriction is indicated in several locations on the Conference website.

<p><li><a name="notification"><strong>I didn't get a notification letter to my submission</a></strong>. 
Due to the short turn around between submission and selection deadlines, we do not send
acknowledgments to each paper submission received. However, e-mail notifications
are sent to each author which e-mail was included on the electronic submissions.
We send e-mail notifying authors and co-authors of their paper status by the end of
August, to those which e-mail address was included in their electronic
submissions. If you did not receive such a notification, please check with the
main POC for the paper first. A duplicate will be e-mailed by request to the Conference
Registrar.
<p><li><a name="paperstatus"><b>How will I get notified about my paper status ?</b></a>
We send e-mail notifying authors and co-authors of their paper status by the end of
August, to those which e-mail address was included in their electronic
submissions. If you did not receive such a notification, please check with the
main POC for the paper first. A duplicate will be e-mailed by request to the Conference
Registrar.

<p><li> <strong><a name="paperlimit1">Is there a limit on how many papers I can submit?</a></strong>
Yes, Any individual is restricted to no more than 4 submissions total (combination of either regular or invited submissions). The limit is included on the Call for papers. Any submission received exceeding the limit will be rejected without review.

<p><li><strong><a name="projector">Will you have PC projectors available for presentations?</a></strong> We no not plan to make PC projectors available at this time.  This decision was reached to keep the registration rate as low as possible.  Overhead projectrors are available for each oral sessions. Poster boards only are available for the poster board sessions. see further details in the author kit section.

<p><li><strong><a name="paperin">When do I need to turn my paper in?</a></strong>  
  Please read carefully as the 2003 Conference procedure has changed as compared
  to that followed in previous years.&nbsp; 2003 Papers must be uploaded at the
  conference website by the advertised deadline (check the &quot;author
  practicalities&quot; link).&nbsp; NO hard-copy papers will be accepted at the
  conference registration desk.&nbsp; Signed IEEE copyright forms must be turned
  in at the registration desk NLT noon on the last day of the conference. Please
  note that only papers with signed copyright forms on file will be included in
  the proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><li><strong><a name="paperlimit2">Is there a page limit?</a> </strong>Yes, no paper may exceed 8 pages total.  Papers in excess of 5 pages are subject to a $100.00 extra charge per page.
