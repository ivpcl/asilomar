TITLE:
Radar CFAR Thresholding in Heavy-Tailed Clutter
and Positive Alpha-Stable Measurements
SHORT DESCRIPTION:
This paper shows how to apply Rohling's order-statistics constant false
alarm rate (OS CFAR) algorithm, developed for a Rayleigh background, to 
the case of heavy-tailed clutter background. In particular, we study the 
performance of the OS CFAR processor when the output measurements of the 
square-law detector can be modeled as Positive Alpha-Stable (\pas) 
random variables with a shape parameter (characteristic exponent) equal 
to 0.5. We derive the exact expressions for the detection and false 
alarm probabilities of the OS and cell averaging (CA) CFAR detectors, 
and compare their performance by means of their corresponding receiver 
operating characteristics.

"A Zero-Forcing Receiver for the DS-CDMA Downlink
Exploiting Orthogonality of Spreading Sequences"
Irfan Ghauri and Dirk T. M. Slock

Abstract:
We address the problem of downlink interference rejection 
in a DS-CDMA system. Periodic orthogonal Walsh-Hadamard sequences 
spread different users' symbols followed by masking by a symbol 
aperiodic base-station specific overlay sequence.
This corresponds to the downlink of the European UMTS wideband 
CDMA norm. The point to point propagation channel from the cell-site 
to a certain mobile station is the same for all downlink signals
(desired user as well as the interference).
The composite channel is shorter than a symbol 
period for some user signals, while other users can have significant 
ISI owing to a faster transmission rate. In any case, orthogonality
of the underlying Walsh-Hadamard sequences is destroyed by multipath 
propagation, resulting in coherent combination of the desired signal and
multiuser interference if a coherent combiner (the RAKE receiver) is
employed. We propose a linear 
zero-forcing (ZF) receiver which equalizes for the estimated 
channel, thus rendering the user signals orthogonal again. A simple 
code matched filter subsequently suffices to cancel the multiple access
interference (MAI) from intracell users.

        Title:  Design of Estimation/Deflation Approaches to Independent
Component Analysis

        Authors:  Scott C. Douglas, Southern Methodist University, and
          S.-Y. Kung, Princeton University

Abstract:  Adaptive algorithms for independent component analysis 
(ICA) attempt to extract multiple independent source signals from
sets of linear mixtures.  In this paper, we consider the design
of one class of algorithms that combine the three tasks of prewhitening, 
estimation, and deflation.  After reviewing several methods for each of 
these tasks, a performance analysis of a general class of 
unit-norm-constrained gradient-based extraction methods is derived.  
This analysis is then used to determine via calculus of variations 
the optimum output nonlinearity for the given algorithm class and 
source statistics.  These results show that (i) the local convergence
behavior of such algorithms can be significantly enhanced by 
matching the output nonlinearity to the source statistics, and (ii)
employing a linear term within the output nonlinearity, such as 
that used in the constant-modulus algorithm, can improve these algorithms'
performances if certain aspects of the extracted sources' statistics 
are known.  Simulations verify the accuracy of the theoretical results.

   Direct Semi-Blind Symbol Estimation for Multipath Channels

   A. Lee Swindlehurst
   Brigham Young University

 A number of recent papers have treated the problem of channel
estimation when known training data is present.  The unknown part of
the signal is typically estimated in an independent step, where the
channel inverse is applied to the received data.  In this paper, a
technique is presented for directly estimating the unknown symbols
in a block of data that also contains training information.  The
channel matrix can also be simultaneously estimated, provided the
channel lengths are not too long.  The proposed method is
implemented in the frequency domain, and works best in situations
where the training data acts to convert the linear convolution of
the channel into circular convolution (as with a cyclic prefix in
multicarrier systems).  However, reasonable results are still
obtained asymptotically even without this constraint.

    We examine the two-sensor distributed detection problem for detecting a 
    known signal in t-distributed noise which is dependent from sensor to
    sensor. The t-distributions include Gaussian, Cauchy and a number of
    other interesting distributions with tails between Gaussian and Cauchy.
    A Gauss-Seidel algorithm which attempts to minimize the Bayes risk is
    used to obtain the best sensor decision regions. The properties of the
    best sensor decision regions are predicted based on the problem's
    parameters. All nonrandomized fusion rules are considered.   In some
    specific cases the optimum distributed detection sensor rules are shown
    to perform better than the best likelihood ratio tests by Monte Carlo
    simulations.

     Robust Matched Subspace Detection and Estimation
     Todd McWhorter and Michael Clark
     Mission Bay Research Inc., Monterey, CA
In this paper we derive robust estimators of the parameters in a
linear subspace model.  Like total least squares (TLS), these
estimators allow for errors in both the data and in the subspace
model.  However, unlike total least squares, these estimators allow
the perturbation of the model to be constrained.  These constraints
have simple geometric interpretations and allow for various levels of
confidence in the a priori signal model.  These estimators are also
distinguished from TLS in that they are invariant to certain arbitrary
scalings and rotations of the signal model.  This property, which TLS
does not possess, is shown to be essential for certain estimation
problems.  We apply these estimators to the matched subspace detection
problem and illustrate, by way of example, that the resulting
detectors are robust.

     Decision Feedback Equalization for Volterra Systems - A Root Method
     by Arthur Redfern and G. Tong Zhou
     Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA
The need to recover the original input from the output of a nonlinear system
is a problem common to many applications.  In this paper, we propose a
Volterra decision feedback equalizer that is based on finding the roots of a
polynomial function of the input.  It is capable of equalizing severely
nonlinear systems under the assumption that the input comes from a finite
symbol set.  A modification is also proposed which allows for the extension
of the root method to baseband Volterra systems with complex inputs and the
analysis of the effects of noise on the current symbol estimate.
Simulations demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.
