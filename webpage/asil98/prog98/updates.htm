    We examine the two-sensor distributed detection problem for detecting a 
    known signal in t-distributed noise which is dependent from sensor to
    sensor. The t-distributions include Gaussian, Cauchy and a number of
    other interesting distributions with tails between Gaussian and Cauchy.
    A Gauss-Seidel algorithm which attempts to minimize the Bayes risk is
    used to obtain the best sensor decision regions. The properties of the
    best sensor decision regions are predicted based on the problem's
    parameters. All nonrandomized fusion rules are considered.   In some
    specific cases the optimum distributed detection sensor rules are shown
    to perform better than the best likelihood ratio tests by Monte Carlo
    simulations.

     Robust Matched Subspace Detection and Estimation
     Todd McWhorter and Michael Clark
     Mission Bay Research Inc., Monterey, CA

In this paper we derive robust estimators of the parameters in a
linear subspace model.  Like total least squares (TLS), these
estimators allow for errors in both the data and in the subspace
model.  However, unlike total least squares, these estimators allow
the perturbation of the model to be constrained.  These constraints
have simple geometric interpretations and allow for various levels of
confidence in the a priori signal model.  These estimators are also
distinguished from TLS in that they are invariant to certain arbitrary
scalings and rotations of the signal model.  This property, which TLS
does not possess, is shown to be essential for certain estimation
problems.  We apply these estimators to the matched subspace detection
problem and illustrate, by way of example, that the resulting
detectors are robust.
