<p>
Edward A. Lee was one of the founders of the Ptolemy project, which
currently serves as the focal point for all of his research. He is
currently a Professor in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
Department at U. C. Berkeley. His research activities include real-time
software, discrete-event systems, visual programming, parallel computation,
architecture and software techniques for signal processing, and design
methodology for heterogeneous systems. He previously directed the Gabriel
project, the predecessor to Ptolemy. 

Prof. Lee's bachelors degree (B.S.) is from Yale University (1979), his
masters (S.M.) is from MIT (1981), and his Ph.D. is from the University of
California at Berkeley (1986). From 1979 to 1982 he was a member of
technical staff at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Holmdel, New Jersey, in
the Advanced Data Communications Laboratory.

Prof. Lee is co-author of Digital Communication, with D. G. Messerschmitt,
Kluwer Academic Press, 1988 (first edition) and 1994 (second edition), and
Digital Signal Processing Experiments with Alan Kamas, Prentice-Hall, 1989,
as well as numerous technical papers. He is a founder of Berkeley Design
Technology, Inc, and has consulted for a number of other companies. 

Prof. Lee is a fellow of the IEEE, and was a recipient of a 1987 NSF
Presidential Young Investigator award.
