    "I am a HAL 9000 computer ... I became operational on January 12, 1997"
 <br>                  -- Arthur C. Clarke
  <br>                    *2001:  A Space Odyssey* (1968 novel)</i>

</center><p>
*2001:  A Space Odyssey*, Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke's 1968
epic film about the space exploration, extra-terrestrials and the
evolution of intelligence, was the most scientifically precise feature
film ever made.  Now, on the occasion of HAL's "birth" (as given in the
novel), we can compare the film's computer science "predictions" with
current technological fact -- in particular those related to its
central character, the HAL 9000 computer.  We review the reflections of
Marvin Minsky, Doug Lenat, Stephen Wolfram, Raymond Kurzweil, Roger
Schank, Donald Norman, Murray Campbell, Daniel Dennett, Ravishankar
Iyer and others concerning the film, specifically addressing topics
such as artificial intelligence, computer vision, computer lipreading,
speech recognition, reasoning, chess, reliability, computer emotion and
interface design.  Where were the film's creators optimistic, where
pessimistic, and why?   What trends and issues were overlooked?  Could
we build a HAL?

<p>This non-technical talk is profusely illustrated with clips from *2001*
and current research and sheds new light on key moments of the film --
you will never see the film the same way again.
