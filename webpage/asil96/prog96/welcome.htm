         It is with great pleasure that I welcome you to the Thirtieth Annual Asilomar Conference
on Signals, Systems and Computers.  Thirty years have established a tradition that makes long-time
attendees look forward with great anticipation to an outstanding experience - one that blends the
excitement of learning about the most advanced technical results with the relaxation of an
unparalleled environment and the pleasure of meeting again with old friends and colleagues. If you
are new to Asilomar, you can look forward to a wonderful event, one that you will certainly want
to have permanently on you calendar.
         The social program begins with the welcoming reception and gathering on Sunday evening
at the Asilomar Hotel and conference grounds. The official conference opening and plenary session
will be held on Monday morning. This year we are indeed fortunate to have as the Plenary Speaker
Dr. Edward. A. Lee, Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at U.C. Berkeley
and one of the founders of the Ptolemy Project. Dr. Lee and his colleagues and students have been
pioneering the development of highly flexible software environments for the design of
communications and signal processing systems, and he will share with us his thoughts and insights
on the design process and its changing character int eh Age of Information. The plenary session will
be followed by the main technical program, which will last until Wednesday noon.
         Two other special events are well worth your attention.  First, as is customary, on Monday
evening the conference attendees and their families will be graciously hosted at the Naval
Postgraduate School's Officer and Faculty Club on the NPS campus in Monterey. This event is
famous for its outstanding buffet, and is an excellent opportunity to meet old friends and to make
new ones.
         Second, for something new and unusual, on Tuesday evening there will be a special
presentation by Dr. David Stork on HAL 9000, the artificially intelligent computer in the science
fiction novel "2001: A Space Odyssey".  According to the novel, HAL became operational in 1997.
Dr. Stork, who directs the Machine Learning and Perception Group at the Ricoh California
Research Center, will use the occasion of HAL's immanent "birth" to reflect on where we actually
stand in achieving HAL's abilities. I am sure that this event, replete with film clips and observations
on the state of computer vision, speech recognition, computational reasoning, chess, reliability,
computer emotion and interface design will make the evening an event to remember.
         The core of the Conference, of course, is the technical program. Assembling that program
requires a great deal of dedication and volunteer effort on the part of many people. This year we
are all indebted to the Technical Program Committee, consisting of Drs. Earl Schwartzlander,
Jr.(Chair), Victor DeBrunner, Michael Ekstrom, frederic harris, John McCanny, Vojin Oklobdzja,
Samuel Sterns, and Stanley White.  It is their service that makes the Conference possible.
         However the Conference would never take place at all without the vital administrative
assistance of Ms. Sue Netzorg of the Naval Postgraduate School.  Much work have also been done
by the Conference committee: drs. C. Choo, M. Fargues, R. Hippenstiel E. Schwartzlander, Jr.,
and A. Singh.  Finally, the corporate memory of the Conference is in the able hands of the
Conference steering Committee,: Drs. C. Therrien (Chair), G. Dillard, D. Elliott, M. Fargues, f.
harris, R. Hippenstiel, H. Jablon, W. Jenkins, D. Kirk. S. Michael, W. Mikhael, J. Ritcey. L.
Scharf. A. Singh. M. Soderstrand. S. Stearns, and S. White. We owe many thanks to these and
other unnamed volunteers who have worked have to make the Conference e a reality. On a personal
level, I must give special thanks to Charlie Therrien and Monique Fargues for their dedication to
keeping "on Schedule and under budget."

Finally, on behalf of the Conference Committee, I invite you to participate in, take full advantage
of, and enjoy the exciting technical and social events at this, the Thirtieth Asilomar Conference.
         Richard O. Duda
         General Chairman
