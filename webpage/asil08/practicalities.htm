	<li>Reduced technical conference fees are available ONLY if you obtain lodging at the conference hotel by returning the hotel registration 
fees included on this site or in the advanced technical program. Lodging reservations made thru a third party outfit, such as Expedia or 
Orbitz for example, or registration made with the Asilomar Conference Center via the Leisure guest program DO NOT QUALIFY for&nbsp;

	details regarding the Hotel conference lodging request process</li>
	<li>Any participant not staying at Asilomar will be required to pay the
off-ground registration fee, even if a room at Asilomar is requested
and the hotel conference is unable to accommodate. </li>
	<li>The Hotel Registration Form must be mailed to the Asilomar Conference 
  Center. The Conference Registration Form must be returned to the proper address. Please, do not mail both forms to one or the other
location, as hotel and conference registrations are handled by two
different groups of staff personnel. We cannot guarantee registration
forms mailed to the wrong location will be forwarded to the correct
one... </li>
