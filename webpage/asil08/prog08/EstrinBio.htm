<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b>Deborah Estrin</b> (Ph.D. 
MIT, 1985; BSEE UCB, 1980) is a Professor of Computer Science at UCLA, holds the 
Jon Postel Chair in Computer Networks, and is Founding Director of the National 
Science Foundation funded Center for Embedded Networked Sensing (CENS). CENS’ 
mission is to explore and develop innovative, end-to-end, distributed sensing 
systems, from ecosystems to human systems. Estrin’s earlier work addressed 
Internet protocol design and scaling, in particular, inter-domain and multicast 
routing. Since the late 90’s her work has focused on multi-disciplinary, 
experimental-systems research as applied to a variety of environmental 
monitoring challenges. Most recently this work includes participatory-sensing 
systems, at the personal and community level, leveraging the location, acoustic, 
image, and attached-sensor data streams increasingly available from mobile 
phones. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Estrin chaired a 1998 DARPA/ISAT 
study on sensor networks and a 2001 NRC study on Networked Embedded Computing 
which produced the report <u>Embedded Everywhere</u>. She served as a founding 
member of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) Advisory board, and 
is currently a member of the NRC Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB), 
and TTI/Vanguard. Estrin was selected as the first ACM-W Athena Lecturer in 
2006, was awarded the Anita Borg Institute’s Women of Vision Award for 
Innovation in 2007, and was inducted as a member of the American Academy of Arts 
and Sciences in 2007. </p>
