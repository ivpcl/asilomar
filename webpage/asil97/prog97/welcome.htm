      It is with great pleasure that I welcome you to the Thirty First Annual Asilomar Conference on
  Signals, Systems and Computers.  The years have established a tradition that makes long-time attendees
  look forward with great anticipation to an outstanding experience   one that blends the excitement of
  advanced technical results with the relaxation of the Pacific Coast.  If you are new to Asilomar, start
  planning now to come next year.
     The social program begins with the welcoming reception and gathering on Sunday evening at the
  Asilomar conference grounds.  The official conference opening and plenary session will be held on
  Monday morning.  This year we are indeed fortunate to have as the Plenary Speaker Dr. Nikil Jayant from
  Lucent Technologies.  The plenary session will be followed by the main technical program, which will last
  until Wednesday noon.
     Tuesday evening the conference attendees and their families will be hosted at the Naval
  Postgraduate School's Officer and Faculty Club on the NPS campus in Monterey.  This event is famous for
  its outstanding buffet and is and excellent opportunity to meet old friends and to make new ones.
     It is a pleasure to indicate that Dr. Nikil Jayant of Lucent Technologies will present the plenary
  talk, entitled Multimedia Communications Research.  He will identify opportunities for interdisciplinary
  breakthroughs.  Significant among these are signal compression and networking co-design, the
  development of algorithms for personalized communications, and ideas for developing networked digital
  libraries.
     The core of the conference, of course, is the technical program.  Assembling that program requires
  a great deal of dedication and volunteer effort on the part of many people.  This year we are all indebted to
  the Technical Program Committee, consisting of Drs. Jerry Gibson, Behnaam Aazhang, George
  Giannakis, W. Kenneth Jenkins, Graham Jullien, Michael Marcellin, and Murali Tummala.  It is their
  service that makes the Conference possible.
     However the conference would not exist without the vital administrative work being done by the
  Conference committee: Drs. C. Choo, M. Fargues, R. Hippenstiel, E. Swartzlander, Jr., and A. Singh. 
  Finally, the corporate memory of the Conference is in the able hands of the Conference Steering
  Committee: Drs. C. Therrien (chair), G. Dillard, D. Elliott, M. Fargues, f. harris, R. Hippenstiel, N. Jablon,
  W. Jenkins, D. Kirk, S. Michael, W. Mikhael, J. Ritcey, L. Scharf, A. Singh, M. Soderstrand, S. Stearns,
  and S. White.  We owe many thanks to these and other unnamed volunteers who have worked to make the
  Conference a reality.  On a personal level, I must give special thanks to Charlie Therrien and Monique
  Fargues for their encouragement in keeping "on Schedule and under budget."
     Finally, on  behalf of the Conference Committee, I invite you to participate in take full advantage
  of and enjoy the exciting technical and social events at the, the Thirty First Asilomar Conference.

			Earl E. Swartzlander, Jr.
