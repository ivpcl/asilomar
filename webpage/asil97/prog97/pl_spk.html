Our capabilities in audiovisual communications are being challenged as we
respond to emerging businesses in high-quality signal storage, broadcasting,
internetworking and natural human-machine interfaces.  To keep up with what the
technological community seems to have promised itself, we are looking for
continued advances in the core disciplines of source and channel coding,
audiovisual networking and automatic systems for machine recognition and
synthesis of speech and visual information.  Some of the advances in these
areas will come from incisive applications from the disciplines of information
theory, psychophysics and audiovisual linguistics.  Some of the progress will
come about by pragmatic use of non-discipline-specific, compute-intensive
methods such as analysis-by-synthesis and correction-by-feedback.
<p>
Perhaps even more compelling than these linear advances are yet-unknown
opportunites for interdisciplinary breakthroughs.  Significant among these will
be the co-design of technologies for signal compression and networking, the
matching of next-generation VLSI memories and processors to emerging algorithms
for personalized audiovisual communications, and the integration of database
science with speech and image interface technologies for enabling widespread
use of information services such as networked digital libraries.

Nikil Jayant:  Professional Biography
<p>Dr. Nikil Jayant is Director of the Mulitmedia Communications Research
Laboratory at Bell Labs, the R&D arm of Lucent Technologies (formerly the
Systems and Technology part of AT&T).  In this position, Dr. Jayant is
reponsible for the creation and commercialization of technologies for
audiovisual communication and mulitmedia information systems.
<p>
Earlier at AT&T Bell Laboratories, Dr. Jayant created and managed the Signal
Processing Research Department and the Advanced Audio Technology Department.
 Dr. Jayant's personal research has been in the field of digital coding and
transmisson of information signals.  He has published over a hundred papers and
several books, and has been granted twenty patents.
<p>
Dr. Jayant received his Ph.D. in Electrical Communication Engineering from the
Indian Institue of Science, Bangalore, India.  He was a research associate at
Dr. Jayant has received several honors, including the IEEE Browder J. Thompson
Memorial Prize Award (for the best IEEE publication by an author under thirty
years of age, 1974) and the IEEE Donald G. Fink Prize Paper Award (for the best
tutorial in an IEEE publication, 1995).  Dr. Jayant is a Fellow of the IEEE and
a member of the National Academy of Engineering.
