    The Asilomar Conference Hotel is located on 105 acres of forest, dune and beach at the tip of California's historic Monterey Peninsula.  Overlooking the Pacific, living and meeting accomodations are set among Monterey pines and cypresses.  As a "Natural Area", Asilomar retains most of the original flora and fauna of the peninsula.  Sea otters and seals swim off-shore.  Deer and raccoons live on the grounds.  The tide pools of the Asilomar State Beach are just a few minutes from the Conference Center.

    Guests at the Hotel will find a heated swimming pool, horsehoe pits, volleyball courts, and an exercise trail.  Barbeques prepared by Asilomar's cooks, or evening campfires, can be arranged in advance.  The services of a State Park Ranger are available for slide talks and nature walks.  Off the grounds, the area offers some of the world's best golf, sport fishing and boating.  Horseback riding is available in the Del Monte Forest.  Golf and tennis may be arranged trough Asilomar.
