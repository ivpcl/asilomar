<h2>A. If you are flying in to San Francisco or San Jose
and don't want to rent a car:</h2>
<blockquote>
 There is a very convenient and cheap way to travel to Monterey via the "Salinas/Monterey Airbus". The Airbus provides motor coach transportation from San Francisco or San Jose Airport.  Buses will pick you up at your airport terminal. 

<br>Airbus coaches run from San Francisco and San Jose airports to Monterey (12 trips daily). The cost is $27.00 one way, $50.00 round trip (discounts are available for 2 or more passengers). 24h advance payment and reservations are required for this fare.  If interested, for further information please contact: <i>Monterey/Salinas Airbus at (408) 442-2877 or  (800) 291-2877</i> (office hours 7am-7pm PST, 7 days a week). 
<br>  The Airbus coach drops passengers downtown Monterey at the bus plaza transit.  It may be possible for passengers to arrange further direct transportation to the Asilomar Conference by inquiring for such a possibility when making reservations with the Airbus.  If you can't arrange for direct transportation with the Airbus, you can can catch a city bus to Asilomar ($1.50 one way) or a taxicab (around $20.00-$25.00 one way) to the Asilomar Conference Center.
<br> The Monterey city bus line going to Asilomar is line 1.  Bus trip takes about 20mn (buses are very safe here).  The Monterey Peninsula (Monterey, Carmel, Pacific Grove) has an extensive bus system which allows people to see much of the Peninsula.  This is a mode of transportation highly recommended for visitors  who wish to see the sights ands are without a car. Complete bus schedule is available in the buses free of charge.
