                    <h4>Paper Presentation Format</h4>
                    <p>
                            Identify your paper presentation format (poster/oral presentation) from the paper ID number which may be obtained from the author list.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Paper identifiers consist of 2 letters, one number, and one optional letter. The first two letters identify the day of presentation, the number the session number, and the last letter identifies split sessions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            To identify the day of the presentation, use:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>MA: Monday Morning</li>
                        <li>MP: Monday afternoon</li>
                        <li>TA: Tuesday morning</li>
                        <li>TP: Tuesday afternoon</li>
                        <li>WA: Wednesday morning</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                            To identify the format of your presentation, use the paper number:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                                Posters: All poster presentation formats have paper numbers with numeric "8", such as MP8a, TP8b, etc ...
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                Oral presentations: All other papers are to be presented by oral presentation 20 minutes long (5mn questions allowed).
                        </li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Instructions for Poster Preparation:</strong>
                        Poster sessions are a good way for authors to present papers and meet with interested attendees for in-depth technical discussions. In addition attendees find the poster sessions a good way to sample many papers in parallel sessions. Thus it is important that you display your message clearly and strikingly so as to attract people who might have an interest in your paper.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            For your poster, a board will be provided which measures 4 ft x 8 ft (height=4 feet and horizontal width=8 feet). Push tacks will be available to tack your paper to the poster. Prepare your poster well in advance of the conference. There will be no time or materials available for last minute preparation at the conference.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            The title of your paper should appear at the top of your poster in CAPITAL letters that are at least 1 inch high. Below the title put author(s) name(s) and affiliation(s). Use pictures, cartoons, and figures rather than text wherever possible. Bright colors greatly enhance the attention of the viewer. Use text sparingly. State the main result of your paper in six or less lines using 3/4 inch high letters. The flow of your paper should be from top left to bottom right. You may use arrows to lead through the paper.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>
                                Poster Presentation:
                        </strong>
                        Prepare a short presentation of about 5 to 15 minutes that can be given to the attendees. Be prepared to repeat presentation several times. Plan to spend the entire session at your poster.
                    </p>
