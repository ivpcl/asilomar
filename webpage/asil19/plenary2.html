                <h4>Canonical Identification: A Principled Alternative to Neural
                  Networks</h4>
            </center>
            <p>
              Deep neural networks are currently the most popular method for
              learning to mimic the input-output relationship of a generic nonlinear
              system, as they have proven to be very effective in approximating
              complex, highly nonlinear functions. However, we still don't understand
              why neural networks work as well as they often do, choosing the right
              architecture is often an art, and, at the end of the day, the results
              are hard to interpret. All this goes against the very foundation of our
              education: to think and design starting from basic principles. In this
              talk, I will discuss a principled alternative to neural networks -- one
              that is readily understood by engineers, and a posteriori may even seem
              profound. This is based on tensor principal components -- or, more
              precisely, low-rank tensor approximation, but used in a very different
              way, to model a nonlinear function of any nonlinearity order. The
              approach has many advantages: it is `universal', intuitive,
              interpretable, comes with theoretical guarantees, and it even works with
              incomplete input data.  The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated
              using standard benchmark datasets, and a challenging student grade
              prediction task.

                <strong>Speaker Biography:</strong><br/>
                 Nikos Sidiropoulos earned his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from
                the University of Marylandâ€“College Park, in  1992. He has served on the
                faculty of the University of Virginia,  University of Minnesota, and the
                Technical University of Crete, Greece, prior to his current appointment
                as Chair of ECE at UVA. His research interests are in signal processing,
                communications, optimization, tensor decomposition, and factor analysis,
                with applications in machine learning and communications. He received
                the NSF/CAREER award in 1998, the IEEE Signal Processing Society (SPS)
                Best Paper Award in 2001, 2007, and 2011, served as IEEE SPS
                Distinguished Lecturer (2008-2009), and currently serves as Vice
                President - Membership of IEEE SPS. He received the 2010 IEEE Signal
                Processing Society Meritorious Service Award, and the 2013 Distinguished
                Alumni Award from the University of Maryland, Dept. of ECE. He is a
                Fellow of IEEE (2009) and a Fellow of EURASIP (2014).
