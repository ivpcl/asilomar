                                                 ABSTRACT


        Photonic devices and systems have begun to play an ever increasing role
        in information processing applications.  Central in this role is the ability
        of photonics systems to provide ultra-fast switching speeds, massive
        interconnectivity, and parallel processing features.  In this presentation,
        we will present and discuss key technology and system demonstrations
        and provide projections on the level of performance that can be expected
        of this technology for the next generation of signal processing, image
        processing, and communication applications.
