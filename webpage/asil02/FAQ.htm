<strong><a name="creditcard">Credit card issues:</a></strong>We do not accept credit cards for the conference registration.  We accept: checks in US dollars drawn on a US bank, traveller checks, cash.  Note however, the Conference grounds hotel accepts credit cards for the hotel registration.

<p><li><strong><a name="registrations">Can I combine hotel and conference registrations?</a></strong>
No, hotel and conference registration must be sent SEPARATELY to the two locations, as indicated on the registration forms.

<p><li><strong><a name="soldoutrooms">I tried to stay at the Conference hotel, but they are sold out, can I still pay on-grounds rates?</a></strong>No, We buy a block of rooms a year ahead, and we offer the rooms on a first come first basis, with priority given to three-day registrants.  Some years rooms get sold out, and most years "historic rate" rooms get sold out quite early. We encourage you to book quite early. The hotel registration process is handled directly by Asilomar staff at the Conference grounds and they will do their best to fit you in.  However, you will be required to pay the conference off-grounds rate if you don't stay on the conference grounds even though you may have requested an on-ground room and were turned away.

<p><li><strong><a name="publishpaper">What are the restrictions for the papers to get published in the Proceedings ?</a></strong>
The conference restricts publication to papers which were presented by one of the authors of the paper, and that at least of the authors of the given paper be registered at the conference.  No exception will be made.  This restriction is indicated on the acceptance letter sent to the POC for each accepted paper, and in several locations on the Conference website.

<p><li><a name="notification"><strong>I didn't get a notification letter to my submission</a></strong>. 
Due to the short turn around between submission and selection deadlines, we do not send acknowldegment to each paper submission received.  We send a letter notifying the POC only for each submission of the paper status by the end of August. If you are not the paper POC, please check with him/her first.  E-mail a request to the Conference Regsitrar who will send a duplicate.

<p><li> <strong><a name="paperlimit1">Is there a limit on how many papers I can submit?</a></strong>
Yes, Any individual is restricted to no more than 4 submissions total (combination of either regular or invited submissions). The limit is included on the Call for papers. Any submission received exceeding the limit will be rejected without review.

<p><li><strong><a name="projector">Will you have PC projectors available for presentations?</a></strong> We no not plan to make PC projectors available at this time.  This decision was reached to keep the registration rate as low as possible.  Overhead projectrors are available for each oral sessions. Poster boards only are available for the poster board sessions. see further details in the author kit section.

<p><li><strong><a name="paperin">When do I need to turn my paper in?</a></strong>  Papers must be turned in at the registration desk during the conference NLT noon on the last day of the conference.  Paers cannot be mailed in to NPS.

<p><li><strong><a name="paperlimit2">Is there a page limit?</a></strong>Yes, no paper may exceed 8 pages total.  Papers in excess of 5 pages are subject to a $100.00 extra charge per page.
