                    <p>
                            In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers has been moved to a fully virtual conference. We have opted for a format where each contributed paper presentation will take the form of a pre-recorded video, available during the original dates of the conference and on-demand after the conference concludes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            We request you to prepare and upload a video of your presentation, comprised of a brief introduction with webcam, if desired, followed by voice over slides for your presentation. This will be posted on the Asilomar on-demand virtual platform. Please note that the file must be a video file in MP4 format (more details below). Please do not try to upload PowerPoint or PDF files.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Our recommended approach to record a compatible video from content displayed on your computer screen and voice recorded via the computer microphone, is to record the presentation using Zoom, available to users on most platforms and in most countries:
                    </p>
                     
                     <h5>Instructions for recording your presentation with Zoom:</h5>
                     <p>   
                        <a href="https://ieeetv.ieee.org/ieeetv-specials/recording-your-presentation-with-zoom">https://ieeetv.ieee.org/ieeetv-specials/recording-your-presentation-with-zoom</a>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For Authors located in China who are unable to access Zoom for free, use of the free software OBS, which allows also to capture simultaneously yourself while speaking and your slides:

                    <p>
                        In order for videos to be verified by the technical program committee, there is considerable urgency in preparing and uploading your video. Accordingly, we ask you that you please finalize your video no later than October 15th. This is a <strong> HARD DEADLINE </strong>. Presentations will not be accepted after this date. Papers for which a video presentation is not received will be considered “no-shows” and will not be published. All video presentations must be completed in English. 
                    </p>

                    <h5>Guidelines for preparing your video: </h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Duration: 15 minutes</li>
                        <li>File size: 250MB max</li>
                        <li>Video file format: mp4</li>
                        <li>Dimensions: Minimum height 720 pixels, aspect ratio: 16:9</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                    Please note the final specifications will be checked at the time of submission and files not compliant may not be uploaded. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Please be sure the video includes the title of the paper, the authors, and a mention to the 2020 Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers.
                    </p>
